# Brevis ZK Journey 🚀
Daily grind on Brevis ZK coprocessor + Starknet. Farming code & airdrops! ✨
## Logbook 📓
**Day 1 (Nov 23, 2025):** Kickoff
Added src/hello.rs.Day 1: Log update with code addition.
Day 2 (Nov 24, 2025): Brevis ZK coprocessor grind – first proof verified on testnet! Streak 2/100 #BrevisZK #Starknet

Day 3 (Nov 25, 2025): Explored Brevis ZK coprocessor APIs; verified multi-proof setup on testnet. Streak 3/100  #BrevisZK #StarknetDay 4 (Nov 26, 2025): Integrated Brevis proofs with Starknet contracts; tested deployment. Streak 4/100  #BrevisZK #Starknet

Day 5 (Nov 27, 2025): Implemented Brevis ZK proof verification in Starknet contract; tested multi-chain data access. Streak 5/100 #BrevisZKDay 10 (Dec 02, 2025): Optimized ZK proof automation script for better efficiency; integrated real-time monitoring with Starknet API calls. Streak 10/100 #BrevisZK #Starknet
 #Starknet- **Day 6 (Nov 28, 2025)**: Built a small Brevis app circuit to prove USDC transfer >500 USDC; generated ZK proof and verified it on Starknet testnet. Explored ZKVM integration for efficient coprocessing. Streak 6/100. Tags: #BrevisZK #Starknet / src/usdc_proof.rs // Basic skeleton for Brevis ZK proof generationNovember 29, 2025: Added simple script to fetch Brevis metrics using API for daily validationDay 7 (Nov 29, 2025): Added simple script to fetch Brevis metrics using API for daily validation. Streak 7/100 #BrevisZK #Starknet
Day 9 (Dec 01, 2025): Analyzed fetched Brevis metrics; implemented automated validation script for ZK proof efficiency, deployed on Starknet testnet for daily monitoring. StreakRan a basic ZK verification test and confirmed the proof passed with default constraints. Logged proof size and generation timeDec 3, 2025
Tested witness generation using updated inputs. Measured performance differences and saved the benchmark results.Explored circuit behavior under variable inputs. Observed minor proof-output deviations and documented the reasoning.Executed an off-chain computation and validated it through on-chain verification. Noted execution-time gaps between both methods.Debugged a proof failure triggered by mismatched input ordering. Fixed the mapping and updated local documentation.Day 11 — Dec 4: Refined the ZK circuit schema and improved proof generation speed. Ran nightly validation on Starknet testnet and saved updated performance logs.Day 12 — Dec 5: Added a dynamic input validator and tested multi-input constraint stability. Enhanced the proof compression routine to keep verification costs low.Day 13 — Dec 6: Integrated Brevis metrics into a local dashboard and performed stress tests. Fixed a constraint-hashing bottleneck and deployed the updated circuit on Starknet.Day 14 — Dec 7: Completed an off-chain vs on-chain proof agreement test with improved tracing. Deployed a new circuit build and finalized the weekly performance logs
