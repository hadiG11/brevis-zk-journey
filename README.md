Brevis Protocol Streak 26/100 - Dec 20, 2025: Explored 
ZK proof aggregation: Simulated batch verification using a simple circuit optimizer. Code snippet: fn aggregate_proofs(proofs: Vec<Proof>) -> Result<Proof, Error> { if proofs.is_empty() { return Err(Error::Empty); } let mut agg = proofs[0].clone(); for p in proofs.iter().skip(1) { agg = agg.combine(p)?; } Ok(agg) } Test: aggregate_proofs(vec![proof1, proof2]) = combined_proof, handled empty vec error, daily streak practice. Tested ZK coprocessor integration with high-throughput scenarios. Completed daily Proving Grounds check-in and reviewed OSS contributions for Sparks rewards.
